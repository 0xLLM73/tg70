# 🧪 Manual Testing Guide - Real Environment

## 🚀 **Quick Start with Your .env File**

Since you have real API credentials, let's test the bot end-to-end:

```bash
# 1. Verify your .env file has all required variables
cat .env | grep -E "(BOT_TOKEN|SUPABASE_URL|SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY|REDIS_URL)"

# 2. Build and start the bot
pnpm build
pnpm start

# 3. In another terminal, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz?detailed=true
```

## 🎨 **User Experience Validation**

### **The "5-Second Rule"**
Ask someone to try your bot and time them:
- [ ] Within 5 seconds, do they understand it's about crypto communities?
- [ ] Do they feel welcomed into the crypto space?
- [ ] Would they want to continue exploring?

### **Mobile-First Check**
Primary test on mobile (where most Telegram usage happens):
- [ ] All text is readable without zooming
- [ ] Interactions feel natural
- [ ] No UI elements are cut off
- [ ] Emojis enhance rather than clutter

### **Error Recovery Test**
Break things intentionally:
- [ ] Send gibberish, can user recover?
- [ ] Rapid-fire commands, does bot stay responsive?
- [ ] Leave idle for 30 minutes, does conversation resume naturally?

## 🚨 **Stop-and-Fix Issues**
